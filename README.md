# technical-incerto-reading-club
This repository contains a website for the Technical Incerto Reading Club meetup group.

## About

We are a group of practitioners and academics that are interested in learning more about Nassim Taleb's risk, statistical and finance works in the Technical Incerto. In this reading club, we will aim to read through the first volume of this series:


**Statistical Consequences of Fat Tails: Real World Preasymptotics, Epistemology, and Applications**

The book is made freely available on arxiv here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.10488

Join us if you are interested in these topics! We will discuss each chapter and present some code reproducing the examples and techniques in the book. All meetings will be done online.

**Meetup details can be found at:** https://www.meetup.com/global-technical-incerto-reading-club

## Contributing to this Repository

The primary goal of this repository is to make management of the website simple. We should be able to handoff this code to future members and organizers without needing to redo the code or needing to train them.

That's why we use a static HTML5UP template hosted on GitHub pages. Changes on the `main` branch are reflected on the website directly.

In general the following will be good practice:

 - Avoid dynamic content
 - Avoid content that will go stale (references to future events...) unless absolutely necessary
 - If you're adding content about a talk or post, try to place it in its own page then link to it.

## Disclaimer

We are not affiliated with Nassim Taleb and the activities of this group are performed in our own capacities and not in those of our employers or professional organizations. Note that no liability will be accepted as a result of attending these meetings.

## Acknowledgements

We are using the `Dopetrope` template from HTML5UP.
